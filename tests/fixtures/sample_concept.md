# Accounting Equation

The **Accounting Equation** is the fundamental principle underlying the double-entry bookkeeping system. It states that:

**Assets = Liabilities + Equity**

## Components

- **Assets**: Resources owned by the business (cash, inventory, equipment)
- **Liabilities**: Obligations owed to others (loans, accounts payable)
- **Equity**: Owner's residual interest in the assets (capital, retained earnings)

## Importance

The accounting equation must always balance. Every transaction affects at least two accounts, maintaining this balance. This is the foundation of the [[Double-Entry System]].

## Example

If a business purchases equipment for $10,000 cash:
- Assets (Equipment) increase by $10,000
- Assets (Cash) decrease by $10,000
- Net effect: Assets remain the same, equation stays balanced
