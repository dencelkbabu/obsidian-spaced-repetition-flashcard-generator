# W01 L01 ACCT1001 - Introduction to Accounting

## 📝 Notes

[[Accounting]] is the systematic process of recording, measuring, and communicating financial information about economic entities. It is often called the "language of business" because it provides a standardized way to communicate financial performance.

The main branches of accounting include:
- [[Financial Accounting]] - focuses on external reporting
- [[Managerial Accounting]] - focuses on internal decision-making
- [[Tax Accounting]] - deals with tax compliance and planning

The [[Accounting Equation]] is fundamental to understanding accounting:
**Assets = Liabilities + Equity**

This equation must always balance, which is why accounting is called a "double-entry" system.
